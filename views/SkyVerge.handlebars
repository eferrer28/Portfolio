<h2>Where are you located?<h2>

<p>Currently living in Portland, OR but once the summer is over I may consider moving as this past winter
  was a bit rough on me.

<h2>Why are you looking for a new position?<h2>

  <p>I just finished my degree and am currently unemployed and wanted an opportunity where I can continue
    to build on my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills while also working with customers on the daily

<h2>Can you summarize your remote work experience?<h2>

<p>My remote work experience comes in the form of my schooling. I just completed a postbac Computer Science program from Oregon
  State and the whole program was done online. I really enjoyed this setting and working with my fellow students worked pretty
  flawlessly due to our heavy use of hangouts/slack and git.

<h2>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?

<h2>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?

  <p>During the recession I had trouble finding work so I left the country for what I thought was going to be a few
    month but ended up turning into almost two years. That would be the time I had taste for traveling.

  <h2>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?

    I first learned these skills in a full stack bootcamp here in Portland a couple of years ago and continued practicing
    on my own during Oregon State's computer science program. The program did have a web development course and a few other
    courses where I was able to work on these technolgies.

<h2>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?

I am good fit for this role because I fit the skillset you are looking for and the company itself seems like it's
everything that I am looking for in a company.

  <p>The last thing I purchased were a pair of converse from shoebuy. Whenever I buy clothes or a pair of shoes I will usually
  only buy something if it is on sale. The first place I check is the promotions on gmail to see if there any discounts or sales
  going on from the vendors I usually buy from. I usually allow for emails when I buy clothes from an online retailer as I like
  getting discounts. If there is nothing of interest in the promotions tab then I head over to reddit and visit a few subreddits to
  look for any discounts on items that may be of interest to me. If there is nothing there then I usually go to the website I am
  planning on buying from and look at the price. I cross check this price with ebay and compare the two. Ebay usually wins more
  often then not.
